# Midterm Review

The first half of the course has challenged me to become a more disciplined and reflective programmer. One of the clearest lessons I’ve learned is the importance of compiling early and often. In Week 01, I submitted code that failed to compile due to a typo in a method call. Since then, I’ve adopted a habit of compiling frequently during development, which has helped me identify errors earlier. I’ve also started relying more on guard statements and commenting consistently after realizing how unreadable my Week 02 code was without proper documentation.

One recurring issue I’ve faced is violating the Programmer’s Pact—particularly the rule about using only a single `return` statement. This mistake showed up in my early implementations of `indexOf`, and I had to revise it after comparing with Leo’s solution. Going forward, I plan to use peer comparisons and code reviews more frequently to catch such structural issues before submitting. I’ve also learned the importance of writing meaningful reflections after each assignment, as they force me to confront my mistakes honestly.

As for course engagement, I’ve been mostly consistent in attending classes. I arrive on time but I do barely contribute to conversations, I recognize I could do more to initiate help when stuck. I want to improve my proactiveness in the second half of the course by reaching out sooner and attempting additional problems outside of the assigned ones. I’ve also enjoyed learning Markdown and will continue writing my reflections this way. My goal is to treat this course like a job—showing up prepared, working diligently outside class, and being open to feedback as a path to growth.
